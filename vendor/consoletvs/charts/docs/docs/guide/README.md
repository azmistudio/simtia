# Getting Started

Laravel charts allows to integrate Chartisan into a laravel application with ease.

Chartisan is a very powerful front-end library that allows creating charts and managing them
with a simple API.

This new version of Laravel Charts uses Chartisan under the hood to get the best experience
possible on the back-end and front-end. You can read more about Chartisan in the official
site at [Chartisan](https://chartisan.dev)

Laravel charts provides features on the top of the Chartisan's PHP adapter to provide a
top-notch laravel experience. This makes creating charts a laravel experience that's quick
and elegant.
